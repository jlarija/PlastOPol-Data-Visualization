# Data Processing for PowerBI Dashboard Showing Distribution of Coastal Waste


In this project, I processed and analyzed waste collection data provided by Rydde volunteers, who contributed to cleaning the coasts of Norway. The analysis and insights derived from this data culminated in an interactive dashboard created using PowerBI, which is accessible online and also available in this repository.

## Overview

The project was aimed at understanding the patterns and trends in coastal waste collection across Norway, using data gathered by the Rydde volunteers. This data was meticulously analyzed through an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted in Python, providing valuable insights into the types, quantities, and distribution of waste collected.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA was performed in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis involved:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering outliers to ensure a clean dataset.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating key statistics to summarize the data, including total waste collected, most common types of waste, and geographical distribution.
- **Visualizations:** Creating charts and graphs to visualize trends in waste collection, such as time series plots showing the amount of waste collected over time, and bar charts highlighting the most common waste items.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Analyzing the geographical spread of waste collection efforts to identify hotspots and areas requiring more attention.

The insights from this EDA informed the creation of the PowerBI dashboard, enabling a more dynamic exploration of the data.

## PowerBI Dashboard

The project's findings are presented in an interactive dashboard built with PowerBI. This dashboard was showcased at the Rydde conference in 2023, in front of a panel of marine experts.

### Features:
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore the data through filters, drill-downs, and interactive charts.
- **Geographical Insights:** Understand where the most significant waste collection efforts took place.
- **Trend Analysis:** View how waste collection efforts evolved over time.

### Accessing the Dashboard:
- **Online Version:** The dashboard is available through PowerBI online, and can be explored interactively. 
- **Static Snapshots:** Static images of the dashboard are available below for a quick preview.

> **Note:** With the free version of PowerBI, you can download the dashboard from this repository and explore it offline.
