# Data Processing for PwerBI Dashboard

In this project I processed waste collection data coming from the Rydde volunteers, who collected waste from the coasts of Norway. 

The project culminated in a dashboard accessible through PowerBI online, which is also uploaded in this repository. Here, the data is visualized. It was presented at the Rydde conference in 2023, in front of a panel of marine experts. 
With the free version of PowerBI it is possible to download and explore this interactive dashboard.

Static snapshots of the dashboard are available below:
